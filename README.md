Instaclone is required to create a new account for this app. When signing
in, the user is required to use a valid and unique email and password. When invalid,
it will display an error that makes sure the user types the correct valid email and
password. When you sign up, it will require an email, username, password, bio,
and a profile image for the InstaClone. To sign in, a valid or unique email and
password are still required. When you sign in or sign up, it will store the
authentication from Firebase Auth.

unique UI design and makes it simple and accessible. It has a post feature with
likes, comments, and descriptions. It has bottom navigation that gives access to

Searching is just made simple. Searching for users requires only a
username to find the users they need and to follow their favorite person. When they
find it, it will show a profile screen of the users and their posts. A profile screen
displays the user’s bio, username, followers, post count, and posted images. In the
search screen, include all post images.
