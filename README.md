## Overview
Instaclone is a simple social media app made with Flutter. This app aims
for people who like to post their pictures and receive more likes and comments to
see more people post, follow, and connect with each other.
Instaclone is a simple app that has great features and has similarities to
Instagram, including double-taping images to like the post, commenting on the
post, customizing profile users and bios, searching for users, zooming pictures,
and posting pictures. The unique features of this app are that it can post gifs and
has a unique UI. The goal of the instaclone is to make simple social media and the
UI more accessible, social, unique, fast, and accurate.

## Operations
This app has mostly simple features and to help the user to use this app these
are the operation of the Instaclone:
- <b> Sign In and Sign Up </b>
Instaclone is required to create a new account for this app. When signing
in, the user is required to use a valid and unique email and password. When invalid,
it will display an error that makes sure the user types the correct valid email and
password. When you sign up, it will require an email, username, password, bio,
and a profile image for the InstaClone. To sign in, a valid or unique email and
password are still required. When you sign in or sign up, it will store the
authentication from Firebase Auth.
- <b>Feed Screen </b>
The feed screen in Instaclone is just like Instagram, but Instaclone uses a
unique UI design and makes it simple and accessible. It has a post feature with
likes, comments, and descriptions. It has bottom navigation that gives access to
search, add a post, and profile. It has also been pulled down to refresh the feed
and see the latest post.
- <b>Search, Profile and Following </b>
Searching is just made simple. Searching for users requires only a
username to find the users they need and to follow their favorite person. When they
find it, it will show a profile screen of the users and their posts. A profile screen
displays the user’s bio, username, followers, post count, and posted images. In the
search screen, include all post images.
- <b>Post and Comments</b>
Posting is just like Instagram, but this one requires only one picture per post
because Instagram is a simple social media site. Posting a picture or gif will show
up on the feed screen, and it will update and sort the latest posts in the feeds. It is
also possible to edit only the description of a user's post.
